## Define a structure to hold student information
struct Student: 
    int id;              ## Student ID
    str name;        ## Student Name
    float grade;        ## Student Grade
:

int joi() {
    ## Create a structure variable
    Student student1;

    ## Initialize the structure members
    student1.id = 101;
    student1.name = "Alice";
    student1.grade = 95.5;

    ## Access and output the structure members
    cout << "Student ID: " << student1.id << endl;        ## Output: 101
    cout << "Student Name: " << student1.name << endl;    ## Output: Alice
    cout << "Student Grade: " << student1.grade << endl;  ## Output: 95.5

    return 0;  ## Indicate successful execution
